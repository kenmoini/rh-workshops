## Ansible Vault

Since Ansible assets are primarily YAML documents, these files can easily be centrally stored in a Git repository and collaborated on. In fact, Ansible thrives with GitOps strategies, as you can learn in the Ansible Tower workshop.

However, what about certain secret bits of information? Donâ€™t store them in a Git repository with your playbooks - ***even if it is a private repo or server!***

This is where **Ansible Vault** comes into play - you can securely store secrets as one-way encrypted variable files.

{{< alert danger >}}Vault ONLY protects data 'at rest'. Once decrypted, play and plugin authors are responsible for avoiding any secret disclosure, see <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html#keep-secret-data">no_log</a> for details on hiding output.{{< /alert >}}

{{% markdownify %}}
- Open the ***vars/secrets.yml*** file in VS Code - feel free to change the values
- In the Terminal, run the following command to encrypt that variable file:

    `ansible-vault encrypt vars/secrets.yml`

- You'll be prompted for an encryption password and upon entering it twice you'll notice that the variable file is now changed to house the encrypted form of those variables
- Now run the following command to test the vaulted variables, enter your password when prompted: `ansible-playbook --ask-vault-pass deploy_db.yml`

This encrypted form of the variables file can be stored in a Git repository and unlocked at runtime so long as the user knows the password to decrypt it.
